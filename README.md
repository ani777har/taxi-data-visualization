# GG Taxi Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Armenian taxi data to uncover mobility patterns and client behavior using data visualization in R. The study includes insights on ride distribution, spatial patterns, and trends over time.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of Armenian taxi rides, including information on trip locations, durations, and timestamps. Various visualizations and animations are used to interpret the data.

## How to Use
1. **Download or clone this repository** to your local machine.
2. Open the **R project file (`GGTaxi.Rproj`)** in RStudio.
3. Run the **R Markdown file (`GG Taxi.Rmd`)** to generate the full analysis.
4. Explore visualizations, including **GIFs** and **movies** of ride distributions.
5. Review the **academic manuscript** and **presentation slides** for an in-depth explanation of findings.

## Files & Structure
- **Academic Manuscript/** → Contains `Manuscript.pdf` with detailed research findings.
- **GIF/** → Includes animations like `taxi_rides_animation.gif` showing ride patterns.
- **Presentation/** → `GG Taxi.pdf` contains slides summarizing the analysis.
- **R/** → Main analysis files:
  - `GG Taxi.Rmd` → R Markdown file with code and results.
  - `GGTaxi.Rproj` → R project file for structured work.
  - `Purpose of the Project.pdf` → Overview of the research goal.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following R libraries installed:
- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
- `tidyverse`
- `sf` (for spatial analysis)
- `gganimate` (for animations)
- `leaflet` (for interactive maps)

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into taxi ride trends in Armenia, visualizing mobility patterns through various static and dynamic graphics.
